        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (packed) fresh strawberry halves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (packed) fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>6 lemons, organic preferred, or more as needed (you may need as many as 10 lemons)</li>
            <li>5 cups water</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine strawberries, blueberries, and 1/2 of the sugar in a bowl. 
                Use a potato masher to lightly crush berries until all blueberries have broken open.
            </li>

            <li>Use a sharp vegetable peeler to peel off just the yellow zest from 6 lemons; 
                add lemon zest to the berry-sugar mixture.
            </li>

            <li>Pour remaining sugar into the bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover and let sit on the counter for 2 to 6 hours, 
                stirring occasionally, or refrigerate overnight if you prefer.
            </li>

            <li>Bring 5 cups water to boil in a saucepan, then add the berry mixture. 
                Immediately turn off heat, and let sit for 5 minutes, stirring a few times.
            </li>

            <li>Set a fine mesh strainer over a heatproof bowl, and pour berry mixture through the strainer; 
                press out liquid gently. Let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Cut the 6 zested lemons in half, and squeeze the juice 
                (through a strainer to catch the seeds) into the bowl.
            </li>

            <li>Taste, and juice in more lemons as desired. You will have another chance to 
                adjust the final flavor after the lemonade is cold.
            </li>

            <li>Transfer lemonade into a pitcher and refrigerate until fully chilled, about 1 hour. 
                Give the lemonade a final taste, and adjust with more fresh lemon juice or sugar if necessary. 
                Fill glasses with ice to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
